# LinkedIn Scraping Tools
## Description
This repository is composed of different utilities that can be useful to scrape LinkedIn data. The tools are written in Python and use the Selenium library to interact with the LinkedIn website. The tools are designed to be used with the Chrome web browser, but can be modified to work with other browsers.

Here are the different tools that are currently available:

| Tool | Description | Python file | LinkedIn Plan Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator Search Scraper | A tool that scraps the profiles available in a given LinkedIn Sales Nav search | *lksn_search_scraper.py* | Sales Navigator (Any) |
| LinkedIn Recruiter Search Scraper (WIP) | A tool that scraps the profiles available in a given LinkedIn Recruiter search | *lkr_search_scraper.py* | Recruiter, Recruiter Lite |
| LinkedIn Visitor | A tool that takes all the profiles available in a given LinkedIn Recruiter search and visits their page, providing a visit notification if the privacy settings are correctly set up | *lk_visitor.py* | Any (even free, but careful of the limitations) |

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArthurVerrez/linkedin-scraping-tools.git
cd linkedin-scraping-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a new file called *lk_credentials.json* at the root of the project and add the following content:
```json
{
    "email": "YOUR_LINKEDIN_EMAIL",
    "password": "YOUR_LINKEDIN_PASSWORD"
}
